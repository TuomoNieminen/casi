# Structure of day 5

### Part 1: What is a neural network?

- Motivation: practical example (image classification)
- Machine learning: find f for which y = f(X). Example: linear model.
- Structure of a neural network (layers, nodes, activation functions)
- Demo: http://playground.tensorflow.org
- Let students play with demo

### Part 2: Training a network

- Generalisation: train and test data
- Loss function (L)
- Backpropagation to find the gradient of L
- Gradient Descent to optimize L (stochastic GD)
- Batches and epochs
- Play with R Keras (mnist exercise)

### Part 3: Different networks

- Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
- Possible home exercise: update mnist model to a CNN
