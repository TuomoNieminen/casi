# Structure of day 5

### Part 1: What is a neural network?

- Motivation: practical example (image classification)
- Structure of a network (whiteboard)
- Comparison to generalized linear models: f(X) -> y
- Demo: http://playground.tensorflow.org
- Let students play with demo

### Part 2: Training a network

- Loss function (L)
- Backpropagation to find the gradient of L
- Gradient Descent to optimize L (stochastic GD)
- Play with R Keras (mnist exercise)

### Part 3: Different networks

- Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
- home exercise: update mnist model to a CNN
