# Structure of day 5

### Part 1: What is a neural network?

*Lecture notes 1.1 - 2.4*

- Motivation: practical example (image classification)
- Machine learning: find f for which f(X) = y. 
- Structure of a neural network (layers, nodes, activation functions)
- Demo: http://playground.tensorflow.org
- Play with demo

### Part 2: Training a network

*Lecture notes 2.5 - 3.6*

- Generalisation: train and test data
- Loss and cost functions (L, C) ([info](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/179026/objective-function-cost-function-loss-function-are-they-the-same-thing))
- Gradient Descent to optimize L. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w&t=5m11s))
- Backpropagation to find the gradient of L
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Play with R Keras (mnist exercise)

### Part 3: Different networks

- Convolutional neural networks (CNN) [explanation](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
- Autoencoders
- Possible home exercise: update mnist model to a CNN
